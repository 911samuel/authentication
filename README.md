## ➤ Description

 What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project stemmed from the need to understand and implement authentication workflows in React Native applications. Authentication is a fundamental aspect of many mobile apps, and I wanted to gain practical experience in handling user authentication securely and efficiently.

Why did you build this project?
I built this project to deepen my knowledge of authentication mechanisms such as email/password authentication and social media logins (e.g., Google, Facebook) within the context of a React Native mobile app. By building a practical authentication workflow, I aimed to enhance my skills in front-end development and user authentication practices.

What problem does it solve?
This project addresses the need for a robust and user-friendly authentication system in mobile applications. By implementing authentication features, users can securely create accounts, log in, and access personalized content or features within the app. This helps in enhancing user experience, maintaining data privacy, and preventing unauthorized access.

What did you learn?
Through this project, I learned:

How to integrate authentication libraries or APIs in React Native projects.
Best practices for user authentication, such as password hashing, token-based authentication, and secure storage of user credentials.
Handling different authentication scenarios, including user registration, login, logout, password recovery, and social authentication.
User interface design considerations for authentication screens, such as login/signup forms, validation, and error handling.
Testing and debugging authentication flows to ensure reliability and security.
Importance of implementing security measures like HTTPS, session management, and secure token handling to protect user data.
