## ➤ Description

 What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project stemmed from the need to understand and implement authentication workflows in React Native applications. Authentication is a fundamental aspect of many mobile apps, and I wanted to gain practical experience in handling user authentication securely and efficiently.

Why did you build this project?
I built this project to deepen my knowledge of authentication mechanisms such as email/password authentication and social media logins (e.g., Google, Facebook) within the context of a React Native mobile app. By building a practical authentication workflow, I aimed to enhance my skills in front-end development and user authentication practices.

What problem does it solve?
This project addresses the need for a robust and user-friendly authentication system in mobile applications. By implementing authentication features, users can securely create accounts, log in, and access personalized content or features within the app. This helps in enhancing user experience, maintaining data privacy, and preventing unauthorized access.

What did you learn?
Through this project, I learned:

How to integrate authentication libraries or APIs in React Native projects.
Best practices for user authentication, such as password hashing, token-based authentication, and secure storage of user credentials.
Handling different authentication scenarios, including user registration, login, logout, password recovery, and social authentication.
User interface design considerations for authentication screens, such as login/signup forms, validation, and error handling.
Testing and debugging authentication flows to ensure reliability and security.
Importance of implementing security measures like HTTPS, session management, and secure token handling to protect user data.

## ➤ React Native Authentication Work-flow Installation Guide
To integrate the Authentication Work-flow into your React Native project, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AntonScheving/Authentication-Workflow.git
2. Navigate to your project directory:
Open your terminal and navigate to your React Native project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd YourProjectDirectory
3. Install dependencies:
Install the necessary dependencies required for authentication and navigation in your React Native project:

bash
Copy code
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens
4. Link dependencies (for Android and iOS):
Link the dependencies to your React Native project for Android and iOS platforms:

bash
Copy code
npx react-native link
5. Copy authentication screens:
Copy the authentication screens (such as Sign Up, Sign In, Forgot Password, etc.) from the cloned repository (Authentication-Workflow/app/screens) to your project's screens directory.

6. Configure navigation:
Set up navigation using React Navigation in your React Native project. You can create a stack navigator to handle authentication-related screens.

Here's a basic example of how you might set up navigation:

javascript
Copy code
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import SignUpScreen from './screens/SignUpScreen';
import SignInScreen from './screens/SignInScreen';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
7. Customize authentication screens:
Customize the authentication screens (e.g., SignUpScreen, SignInScreen) based on your app's design and functionality requirements.

8. Configure authentication services:
Implement authentication services using libraries like Firebase, AWS Cognito, or your own backend API. Handle user registration, login, password recovery, and authentication logic.

9. Test the authentication flow:
Run your React Native project on a simulator/emulator or a physical device to test the authentication flow. Verify that user registration, login, and authentication functionalities work as expected.

10. Deployment (optional):
If you plan to deploy your React Native app with authentication features to app stores or devices, follow the deployment guidelines provided by React Native or the platform you are targeting.

That's it! You have now integrated the Authentication Work-flow into your React Native project.



AUTHENTICATION WORK-FLOW is built with the following tools and libraries: <ul><li>React Native</li><li>Expo</li><li>expo/metro-runtime</li><li>expo-google-fonts/space-grotesk</li></ul>
